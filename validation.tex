\section{Introduction \label{sec:intro}}
The purpose of this document is to work in concert with the "Requirements for the 
LSST Simulation Framework" (hereafter Requirements; \cite{requirements}) to validate the
base catalogs and catalogs generation framework for use in the context of
LSST investigations. 
\section{Validation of the Requirements on the Catalog Simulations}
This section will show in detail whether each requirement is being met and if it is not
being met what the impact on the project measureables and design goals is.
\subsection{Requirement 1: The LSST catalogs simulations shall contain representations of stars,
galaxies, asteroids, and variable sources}
\subsection{Requirement 2: At high Galactic latitudes the average source densities of stars and galaxies
shall be within 18\% of the observed counts (to the 5$\sigma$ point source coadded depth of LSST)}
\subsection{Requirement 3: Size, ellipticity and redshift distributions of galaxies shall be representative of those observed by extant
telescopes and, for a fiducial image quality of 0.7 arcsec, deviations from the observed distributions shall
contribute $< 20\%$ of the observed effective density of galaxies, $n_{eff}$, used in the weak lensing samples (with a fiducial value of
$n_{eff} = 34$ galaxies per arcmin$^2$}
\subsection{Requirement 4: For the photometric calibration simulations
the distribution of stellar colors shall encompass the colors of white dwarfs through red giant branch stars.
The median color distributions of stars must trace the observed colar locus for these stars to within 0.1 magnitudes
(averaged over intervals of 0.3 magnitudes in color).}
\subsection{Requirement 5: All models for the astrometric transforms applied tothe catalogs (including interpolation functions) 
shall have an accuracy better than 1.6 mas}
\subsection{Requirement 6: The system shall be capable of incorporating new astrophysical catalogs without requiring
a redesign of the class-schema framework}
